## Description

**What is the Firebase Train Scheduler?** The firebase Train scheduler is an application utilizing firebase as a location to store data that is accessible to all potential users of the website. This partiular page is designed with the theme of a train schedule board showing the times of the trains as submitted by the user.

**How Does Word Guess Game Work?** When the page loads, a call to firebase is submitted to collect all data on the trains submitted. When the data is retrieved, it is processed in the browser via javaScript. Train time and Frequency data is used to calculate the remaining minutes until the next occurence that the train will arrive.
