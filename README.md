# Firebase-Train-Scheduler


learning firebase was difficult, but once i got it, things fell into place. 

Doing the math to calculate the number of minutes remaining for the next train was tricky, but i managed it in one session.


and then the same small kinds of issues like minor scoping and CSS styling gave me trouble. I also set my reset after bootstrap, which messed with the styling as well.
